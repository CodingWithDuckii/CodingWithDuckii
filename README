# Hi there 👋, I'm Duckii

I'm a passionate coder and student with a love for creating modern, interactive apps and bots. I enjoy building projects that are both fun and practical, focusing on full-stack development, Discord bots, and web projects.

## 🛠️ Languages & Technologies

Here are the languages and tools I work with:

- **Python** – Discord bots, automation, backend logic  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Web development, frontend design  
- **Lua** – Roblox scripting and game development  

I’m always exploring new languages and frameworks to expand my skills.

- **[Task.gg](https://task-gg.vercel.app/)** – A modern Discord bot and dashboard managing tasks, reminders, and server utilities.  

*(More projects are in development!)*
